        Mirroring both Princeton WordNet and EuroWordNet initiatives,
        and extending the Brazilian Portuguese Thesaurus,
        the Brazilian Portuguese WordNet (WordNet.br) project was launched in 2003.
        Roughly, the WordNet.br database contains 44,000 word-forms and 18,500 synsets: 
        11,000 verbs (4,000 synsets), 17,000 nouns (8,000 synsets), 15,000 adjectives (6,000 synsets),
        and 1,000 adverbs (500 synsets).
